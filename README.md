Project Title: Improving infant safety using machine learning

This repo contains the code and exploratory results for this project.

Directories:

Code - Contains the MATLAB file for processing the sample audio recordings (of Infant laughter and crying) from the Open-access Freedsound database.

Results - Contains the exploratory results of the study, with two brief plots. The first and the second plots illustrate the differences between infant crying and laughter based on the energy density function in frequency-time domain and frequency domain, respectively. The plots suggest that infant crying results in the concentration of acoustic energy at low pitch.
